# my_tasks

This is my first flutter application made to learn this framework standards and practices.

## Info

The application is a simple tasks manager, that can track the task progress. You can archive your task, then delete it.

Everithing is stored using SQLLite DB with just one table.

I used stream to manage the status of the tasks list, setState approach for the state inside the metadata form.

The stream is managed by a Task BLoC provided by a BlockProvider initialized on the TabAppBar Widget.
